# HTML-Scented Markdown: Paragraph Logic

> This is a description of the CSS logic that keeps track of first and last

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First and Last Paragraphs

This CSS keeps track of whether each paragraph (`<p>` tag) is the first or last
in a run of paragraphs. This is done using the (Boolean-esque) CSS variables
`--is-first` and `--is-last`. (I say Boolean-esque since CSS variables do not
have a special Boolean type, but these variables are always set to either `1`
[true] or `0` [false].)

For this finding of last and first paragraphs to work properly, the
[indentation mode](index.html#indentation) needs considered, as `--is-first`
and `--is-last` should only true for all paragraphs that are the first and last
paragraph in a run of paragraphs *with the same indentation mode*. There are
three indentation modes, specified by one of the following class names:

* `book`---*Book indent* (default). Indent the first line of each paragraph
  (except in a paragraph directly after heading, table, image or other matter).
* `hanging` or `contd`---*Hanging* or *continued indent*. First line is
  outdented, all the other lines are indented. (*Continued indent* looks the
  same as book indent, except that the whole paragraph has an extra
  indentation. Used to continue a paragraph with hanging indent without
  outdenting the first line.)
* `blank`---*Blank spacing.* Paragraphs are separated from each other a
  vertical blank space. (This the most common paragraph separation on the web.)

**Note:** A paragraph can be both first and last at the same time! (E.g. if
there's only one paragraph in a `<div>` or under a heading.)


# Indent Class Inheritance

Indent classes are inherited by child elements. (This is by design.)

This is achieved using CSS variables, but since CSS selectors can't match
against CSS variables, a little bit of Boolean magic is needed to find which
paragraphs are first and last in runs of paragraphs of the same type.

Some pseudo code for describing what the CSS does:

```
// Default.
--is-first: true
--is-last: true

// Unset 'first' and 'last' in two adjacent <p> of same type.
foreach (two adjacent <p>s) {
  if ((both <p> have same explicit ident class OR
       both <p> inherit same class
    ) OR (
      only one <p> has an explicit ident class AND
      that class == inherited class
  )) {
    for 1st <p> set --is-last: false
    for 2nd <p> set --is-first: false
  }
}
```

Naturally, that is *waaaayy* more complicated in the CSS itself.


## A Note on the Logic

Above, the default state is to assume that each paragraph is first, and last,
until the opposite can be proven. This may seem like it's the wrong way around,
since in a typical text most paragraphs are in the middle, but if we reverse
the logic (and assume that all paragraphs are middle paragraphs until proven
last and/or first) there are many more cases to test for. (Such as if a
paragraph is the first inside its parent, or if the comes after a non-paragraph
tag.)

In the end, by reversing the logic (assuming that all paragraphs are first and
last until the opposite is proven), we only ever need to consider adjacent
paragraphs (selector `p + p`), meaning that we need to write fewer selectors,
and handle fewer corner cases (and probably will have fewer bugs).
