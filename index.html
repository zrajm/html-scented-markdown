-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I often toss together a simple page in order to explore a topic, think about,
or design a thing. I cannot be bothered by details when I'm writing these
(because that's a surefire way to get me distracted). Five levels down in that
rabbit hole lies this web page.

A while back I decided to systematize my earlier (and future) scribblings and
collect them in one spot. That spot is here ([zrajm.org]), and the system is
one of *laziness, impatience and hubris.*---I simply toss whatever meandering
thought crosses my mind into a text file, *[that isn't really a text
file](#tastes-like-markdown),* throw it onto the garbage heap that is the
internet, and hope something good come of it. And here all you little trash
pandas can dig it up.


# Smells Like HTML

The file into which I write these words smells like HTML---it has an `.html`
file extension, and contains *juust enough* HTML-smelling preamble to convince
your browser that it can be loaded:

```
<!DOCTYPE html><meta charset=utf-8><!--*- markdown -*-->
<link rel=stylesheet href=www/nojs.css><textarea disabled>
```

At the very end you'll also find a little chunk of line noise. The task of this
line is to invoke a Javascript incantation that allows your machine friend to
produce a pretty document for you:

```
&lt;/textarea><script type=module src=www/main.js></script>
```

But the meat of the file? Yeah, that's ... *different.*


# Tastes Like Markdown

While the page you're currently looking at smells HTML to your browser, the
human story is quite different. (To have look at the source, press **Ctrl+U**,
or **⌘U** on Mac.) However, the HTML shtick is just *pretense.*

If you peel off the skin and take a bite, you'll notice that this file tastes
rather like plain text. The meat of the file is in [Markdown] format. This is
plain text *with a few extra quirks.* It reads pretty much like an old-fashion
email, or something written on a typewriter in the seventies.

The benefit of this is that it is readable *like text,* reading and
proofreading is a breeze.


# Transmogrified by Javascript

Between the Markdown and the HTML lies a layer of Javascript magic.

Initially I was using [Jquery] (for DOM manipulation), and [Showdown] (for
Markdown handling), but even in their slimmed down versions they're pretty
hefty and contain a lot of stuff I never used. So eventually I came to write my
own:

* [Baremark]---A minimal Markdown parser.
* [Elemental]---For DOM manipulation (replacing Jquery).
* [Quotecurl]---For pretty quotes and dashes.

The script [`main.js`](www/main.js) ties it all together.


## Baremark → HTML

[Baremark] and [Quotecurl] are used to render the Markdown into HTML, and,
additionally, the following [Baremark Addons] are also loaded.

| See           | Description                        | Name                           |
|---------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|               | Turn URLs into links               | [`autolink.js`][autolink.js]   |
| [Docs][id]    | `[#id]` for named HTML anchor      | [`id.js`][id.js]               |
| [Docs][meta]  | Email-header style metadata        | [`meta.js`][meta.js]           |
|               | <tt>\^sup\^</tt> for ^superscript^ | [`sup.js`][sup.js]             |
| [Docs][table] | GFM-style tables                   | [`table.js`][table.js]         |
| [Docs][toc]   | Table-of-contents                  | [`toc.js`][toc.js]             |
|               | Remove HTML comments               | [`uncomment.js`][uncomment.js] |


## Scroll Position Restoring

Since the HTML of the page is generated rather than loaded, the browser will
not reliably restore set scroll position for hash fragment URLs. To solve this
hash location is reset after page load, if the current scroll position is at
the top of the window. (The top-of-the-window limitation is to preserve the
scroll position if the user reloads the page.)


## Scroll-to-Top Button

When scrolling down slightly beneath the fold, a scroll-to-top button will
slide into position itself in the bottom right corner.

Clicking the button will scroll to the top of the page, creating a new history
event. To get back to where you came from, just click the history 'Back' (←)
button.


## Wrapping of Chapters

Each heading (`<h1>`...`<h6>`) and their subsequent content (that is, each
chapter), is wrapped in `<div>` tags, and the `id` attribute of the
corresponding `<h#>` tag is moved to the wrapper.---This is done to allow a CSS
`:target` selector to style the entire chapter.

**Nota Bene:** The seemingly apt `<section>` tag is nousegenerally problematic, and
is best avoided altogether in HTML documents, since it's use will affect the
style of any contained `<h1>` tags (specifically font size), and also result in
warnings being displayed in on Firefox developer's console.---The advice given
by the [Mozilla page on `<section>`] is basically to never use it if any other
tag can do the job instead. The `<section>` tag was part of a suggested HTML5
*Document Outline* feature (now deprecated), which in practice was never
implemented by browsers, and should therefore not be relied on ("[There Is No
Document Outline Algorithm]").

[There Is No Document Outline Algorithm]: https://adrianroselli.com/2016/08/there-is-no-document-outline-algorithm.html


# Skinned by CSS

* [`nojs.css`](www/nojs.css)---Very simple stylesheet for when Javascript isn't
  available. Its only job is to render the raw Markdown fairly readable, and to
  display a "No Javascipt" warning. (This stylesheet is unloaded as soon as
  Javascript is up and running.)
* [`main.css`](www/main.css)---A stylesheet for rendering HTML elements. It
  should be minimal, but also mobile friendly, and be able to handle dark mode,
  plus all standard HTML tags. It should also be pretty. :)


## CSS Reset

My `main.css` file starts with Matt Smith's [CSS reset for minimalists], with a
tiny tweak.

```
html { box-sizing: border-box }
*, :before, :after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  text-indent: 0;
}
```

I've added a line to stop the inheritance of `text-indent`, which otherwise
would be inserted into child *block* elements. Like this (extra space in front
of "tatu"):

<style>.dWrfp {text-indent:2em;outline:1px solid currentColor}</style> <p
class=dWrfp>Velut luna <span class=dWrfp
style="display:inline-block">tatu</span> variabilis semper crescis aut
decrescis vita detestabilis nunc obdurat et tunc curat ludo mentis aciem.</div>


## Fonts

I haven't quite settled on this yet.

I do a lot of weird stuff with writing systems. (Like [Swedish sign language
transcription](/teckentranskription/intro.html), or [Canadian Aboriginal
Syllabics](/toki-pona-syllabics/), or even [ASLwrite](/teckenskrift/).) And so,
whatever I finally settle for will have to be able to handle this.


## Inspiration for CSS

I'm sorta constantly trying to figure out what a good web page design should
be. Like with most other things I'm searching for some kind of (technological)
minimalism. Something that's easy to move between servers, and which doesn't
have a lot of dependencies. Here's a list of stuff that I have looked to for
inspiration.

* [Just Enough CSS for a Blog]---Design philosophy. How to create a CSS for
  pretty-looking blog.
* [Web Compendium: CSS: Methodologies]---Page an various approaches for CSS
  design.
* [Web Compendium: CSS]---Describes various CSS related APIs and stuff.
* [Old CSS, New CSS]---A history of CSS development.
* [Matt Smith]---Contains a lot of bite-sized snippets on CSS and Javascript
  design. (Somewhat cumbersome to navigate.)


### List of Frameworks

These are websites which have lists of CSS:s to download. I'm always looking
for *uncomplicated*---solutions that doesn't require compiling, makefiles or
suchlike, only plain CSS.

Minimal requirements for me include: *dark mode,* and *looking great on
mobile.*

* [Awesome CSS Frameworks]---Github README lists a bunch of different CSS
  frameworks.
* [CSS Bed]---List of classless CSS files, with an interface to quickly look at
  them.
* [MVP.css]---One minimalist CSS.
* [Water.css]---Another minimal classless CSS with support for dark mode & and
  mobile.


# Using the CSS

## Book Indent

This CSS uses *book indent*---meaning that the first line of each paragraph in
indented. In cases where a blank line between paragraphs is desired instead,
use an empty paragraph.

This means that if you start a paragraph with `<p><p>` in the Markdown will be
separated from the above paragraph with a blank line. (For a larger separation,
use a `<hr>` or [Markdown dinkus](/baremark/#dinkus------).)

## Dark Mode

If *dark mode* is selected in the user's browser settings it will be honored by
this CSS. If you want to add a dark mode override switch (allowing the user to
manually switch between the modes) include the following HTML anywhere on your
page:

```
<input id=darkmode type=checkbox>
```
