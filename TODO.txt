* [10/11] Cleanup indentation mode CSS
  Merge into main CSS, do the fixes mentioned in the CSS code.
** DONE Support 'book', 'hanging' & 'blank'
   CLOSED: [2025-06-29 Sun 17:27]
** DONE Fixed vertical space on first/last `<p>` inside `<div>`
   CLOSED: [2025-06-30 Mon 21:19]
** DONE Rename variables and invert logic
   CLOSED: [2025-07-01 Tue 02:33]
   Variable names `--book-keep` and `--hanging-keep` are hard to understand.
   Rename these `--is-book` and `--is-hanging` and invert their logic. The `is`
   prefix makes it obvious that they are Boolean values, setting them to `1`
   (true) in respective mode is more intuitive than having the logic being
   inverted.
** DONE Add 'contd' indent class
   CLOSED: [2025-07-01 Tue 02:34]
** DONE Allow `<script>` and `<style>` tags in runs of `<p>`?
   CLOSED: [2025-07-01 Tue 03:37]
   One `<script>` and/or `<style>` tag may now be inserted between any `<p>`
   tags without affecting how the CSS adds 'text-indent' to book indented
   `<p>`s.
** DONE Document the metadata stuff!
   CLOSED: [2025-07-01 Tue 04:34]
** DONE Insert the actual vertical margins (not 1rem)
   CLOSED: [2025-07-01 Tue 04:44]
** DONE Fix `margin-top` rules
   CLOSED: [2025-07-03 Thu 05:14]
** DONE Fix `margin-bottom` rules
   CLOSED: [2025-07-09 Wed 19:21]
** DONE Blank `<div></div>` between paragraphs should result in blank
   CLOSED: [2025-07-09 Wed 19:21]
   Should our old `<p><p>` trick also work?
** TODO Merge `paragraphs.css` into `main.css`
* TODO Table-of-content: Use bullet list with lines(?)
  https://zrajm.org/baremark/
* TODO Table-of-content: Hanging indent
  Very long headings needs some indentation so as to not appear as two headings
  in the table-of-content.
* TODO Git commit hook verifying that date of 'Updated' header has changed
* TODO `quotecurl()` should be invoked on 'title' attributes too
* TODO Fix scroll shadow
* TODO Gradient scroll shadow?
  This article lists a live example at the end with a gradient scroll shadow,
  which looks kinda nice. Maybe adopt this?

* TODO Prettier scroll-to-top button?
  The button should maybe resemble the dark mode switch more?
* TODO List should have same spacing as blockquotes
  Numbered and bulleted lists should have the number/bullet have the same
  horizontal spacing as the left (colored) border of the blockquote.
* TODO On big screen: Put tables-of-content in sidebar
* TODO URL comments in CSS should be in docs
  The origin of various little tricks are given in CSS comments, but they
  should be in the docs file.
* TODO Test/verify Chrome scrollbar
* TODO References to `.img` in CSS?
  Possibly replace with `:has(img:only-child)`? Nope, won't work. `:only-child`
  matches as long as it is the only subelement, however, other text does not
  affect the match.

  E.g. `<td>lext <a href="...">link</a</td>` would be matched by td `a:only-link`.
* TODO Classes for indent modes
  It should be possible to wrap (e.g. the paragraphs of a glossary) in
  something like `<div class=hanging>` to get hanging indent for those
  paragraphs. Specifying `<p class=hanging>` for an individual paragraph should
  also work.

  What should the modes be called?

  Paragraph mode: There are three modes, controlled by the following HTML
  attributes. Is inherited, so you can wrap any number of paragraphs with a
  <div hanging>.

    'book'    -- separate paragraphs by indenting first line, except for first
                 paragraph (default)
    'blank'   -- separated by blank lines
    'hanging' -- hanging indent (default in tables)

  Should text in tables be indented according to the current indent mode?
* FINISHED
** DONE Weed out vertical rhythm stuff
   CLOSED: [2025-06-12 Thu 11:06]
   Remove the DEBUG stuff.
   + Remove `getBaselineFromTop()`
   + Remove `getRhythm()`
** DONE Add scroll-to-top button
   CLOSED: [2025-06-23 Mon 16:06]
   When scrolling beyond the fold a scroll-to-top button should appear in the
   bottom right corner.
** DONE Use `<p>` instead of `<h2>` for subtitle inside `<hgroup>`
   CLOSED: [2025-06-24 Tue 01:44]
   `<hgroup>` should not contain multiple headings, but only a single heading
   with optional preceding or following `<p>` tags, so the way we previously
   did this was wrong.

   The `<hgroup>` HTML element represents a heading and related content. It
   groups a single `<h1>`â€“`<h6>` element with one or more `<p>`.

   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/hgroup
** DONE Wrap each chapter (heading + text) in `<div>`
   CLOSED: [2025-06-24 Tue 05:59]
   Wrap each heading & its content in a `<div>` tag, moving the `id` attribute
   of the `<h#>` tag to the wrapping `<div>` instead. (This is so that a CSS
   `:target` can hilite the entire section instead of just the heading.)

   Originally the intent was to use `<section>` tags here, not `<div>` tags.
   But the `<section>` is fraught with troubles in most browsers (it'll
   currently modify the size of any `<h1>` inside of it, but also display a
   deprecation warning in the Firefox developers console).
** DONE Put only `www` directory + template file in Git
   CLOSED: [2025-06-24 Tue 11:07]
   Ideally one should be able to check the entirety of this repo out as a
   `www/` directory, and then copy an empty `template.html` file from there to
   start a new project.

   In this repo there should also be a Git commit hook script available (which
   is easily installable) which verifies that the `Update:` header has been
   updated when committing an HTML file.
** TODO Finish writing rudimentary version of docs
