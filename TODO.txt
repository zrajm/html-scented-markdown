* TODO Prettier scroll-to-top button?
  The button should maybe resemble the dark mode switch more?
* TODO List should have same spacing as blockquotes
  Numbered and bulleted lists should have the number/bullet have the same
  horizontal spacing as the left (colored) border of the blockquote.
* TODO On big screen: Put tables-of-content in sidebar
* TODO Add <section> tags
  For each heading. Also heading 'id' attribute should be moved to the
  <section> tag.
* TODO URL comments in CSS should be in docs
  The origin of various little tricks are given in CSS comments, but they
  should be in the docs file.
* TODO Test/verify Chrome scrollbar
* TODO References to `.img` in CSS?
  Possibly replace with `:has(img:only-child)`? Nope, won't work. `:only-child`
  matches as long as it is the only subelement, however, other text does not
  affect the match.

  E.g. `<td>lext <a href="...">link</a</td>` would be matched by td `a:only-link`.
* TODO Classes for indent modes
  It should be possible to wrap (e.g. the paragraphs of a glossary) in
  something like `<div class=hanging>` to get hanging indent for those
  paragraphs. Specifying `<p class=hanging>` for an individual paragraph should
  also work.

  What should the modes be called?

  Paragraph mode: There are three modes, controlled by the following HTML
  attributes. Is inherited, so you can wrap any number of paragraphs with a
  <div hanging>.

    'book'    -- separate paragraphs by indenting first line, except for first
                 paragraph (default)
    'blank'   -- separated by blank lines
    'hanging' -- hanging indent (default in tables)

  Should text in tables be indented according to the current indent mode?
