* TODO Fix scroll shadow
* TODO List should have same spacing as blockquotes
  Numbered and bulleted lists should have the number/bullet have the same
  horizontal spacing as the left (colored) border of the blockquote.
* TODO On big screen: Put tables-of-content in sidebar
* TODO When scrolling down: Show scroll up button
* TODO Add <section> tags
  For each heading. Also heading 'id' attribute should be moved to the
  <section> tag.
* TODO URL comments in CSS should be in docs
  The origin of various little tricks are given in CSS comments, but they
  should be in the docs file.
* TODO Test/verify Chrome scrollbar
* TODO References to `.img` in CSS?
  Possibly replace with `:has(img:only-child)`? Nope, won't work. `:only-child`
  matches as long as it is the only subelement, however, other text does not
  affect the match.

  E.g. `<td>lext <a href="...">link</a</td>` would be matched by td `a:only-link`.
* FINISHED
