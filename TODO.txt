* TODO Table-of-content: Hanging indent
  Very long headings needs some indentation so as to not appear as two headings
  in the table-of-content.
* TODO Git commit hook verifying that date of 'Updated' header has changed
* TODO `quotecurl()` should be invoked on 'title' attributes too
* TODO Fix scroll shadow
* TODO Gradient scroll shadow?
  This article lists a live example at the end with a gradient scroll shadow,
  which looks kinda nice. Maybe adopt this?

* TODO Prettier scroll-to-top button?
  The button should maybe resemble the dark mode switch more?
* TODO List should have same spacing as blockquotes
  Numbered and bulleted lists should have the number/bullet have the same
  horizontal spacing as the left (colored) border of the blockquote.
* TODO On big screen: Put tables-of-content in sidebar
* TODO URL comments in CSS should be in docs
  The origin of various little tricks are given in CSS comments, but they
  should be in the docs file.
* TODO Test/verify Chrome scrollbar
* TODO References to `.img` in CSS?
  Possibly replace with `:has(img:only-child)`? Nope, won't work. `:only-child`
  matches as long as it is the only subelement, however, other text does not
  affect the match.

  E.g. `<td>lext <a href="...">link</a</td>` would be matched by td `a:only-link`.
* TODO Classes for indent modes
  It should be possible to wrap (e.g. the paragraphs of a glossary) in
  something like `<div class=hanging>` to get hanging indent for those
  paragraphs. Specifying `<p class=hanging>` for an individual paragraph should
  also work.

  What should the modes be called?

  Paragraph mode: There are three modes, controlled by the following HTML
  attributes. Is inherited, so you can wrap any number of paragraphs with a
  <div hanging>.

    'book'    -- separate paragraphs by indenting first line, except for first
                 paragraph (default)
    'blank'   -- separated by blank lines
    'hanging' -- hanging indent (default in tables)

  Should text in tables be indented according to the current indent mode?

   When scrolling beyond the fold a scroll-to-top button should appear in the
   bottom right corner.
** DONE Use `<p>` instead of `<h2>` for subtitle inside `<hgroup>`
   CLOSED: [2025-06-24 Tue 01:44]
   `<hgroup>` should not contain multiple headings, but only a single heading
   with optional preceding or following `<p>` tags, so the way we previously
   did this was wrong.

   The `<hgroup>` HTML element represents a heading and related content. It
   groups a single `<h1>`â€“`<h6>` element with one or more `<p>`.

** DONE Wrap each chapter (heading + text) in `<div>`
   CLOSED: [2025-06-24 Tue 05:59]
   Wrap each heading & its content in a `<div>` tag, moving the `id` attribute
   of the `<h#>` tag to the wrapping `<div>` instead. (This is so that a CSS
   `:target` can hilite the entire section instead of just the heading.)

   Originally the intent was to use `<section>` tags here, not `<div>` tags.
   But the `<section>` is fraught with troubles in most browsers (it'll
   currently modify the size of any `<h1>` inside of it, but also display a
   deprecation warning in the Firefox developers console).
